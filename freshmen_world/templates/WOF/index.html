                    <p> A teachers' union is calling for a delay in reopening schools after the Christmas holiday
                        because of
                        the rapid spread of Omicron.</p>
                    <p>The Scottish Secondary Teachers Association (SSTA) says there are already staffing issues and
                        the
                        problem is likely to get worse.</p>
                    <P>However, the Scottish government has insisted there are currently no plans to close schools.
                    </P>
                    <P>It comes as a number of colleges return to blended learning this week.</P>
                    <P>The move is aimed at protecting staff and students amid the rapid spread of the Covid-19
                        variant.
                    </P>
                    <P>Colleges Scotland said several colleges were also planning hybrid teaching for the first two
                        weeks of
                        next year.</P>
                    <P> Seamus Searson, general secretary of the SSTA teaching union, told the BBC's Good Morning
                        Scotland
                        programme he was already hearing about schools that were not fully staffed due to rising
                        Covid
                        cases.</P>
                    <P> And he said parents were keeping their children off to ensure they did not catch Covid in
                        the run-up
                        to
                        Christmas.</P>

                    <p>Job title: International Student Adviser</p>
                    <p>Core working hours: Mon: 9.30-14.30, Tue-Fri: 9.30-17.00</p>
                    <p>About me: My career started out in hotel management after University and then I progressed to
                        international student recruitment, mainly in East Asia. I really enjoyed the travel, seeing
                        new
                        places and getting to meet students and their families in their own cities.</p>
                    <p>Since 2010 I have been an International Student Adviser at the University of Glasgow. I love
                        meeting
                        students at the start of term during our Welcome & Orientation activities then seeing them
                        progress
                        all the way to graduation.</p>
                    <p> A main part of my role, as well as providing immigration advice, is to manage our Welcome
                        Team who
                        support our newly arrived international students at the start of term. We organise
                        information
                        sessions, fun events and a welcome desk so students can reach out with any questions.</p>
                    <p>In my spare time I am always out walking whether it be sunshine or rain, I love the outdoors
                        and
                        Scotland is the perfect place to explore.</p>
